#### 2. I bet you didn't understand anything, so choose [easy programming language](http://php.net/) with an *elephant*.

#### 3. What is IDE? We already have *elephant* [text editor](https://evernote.com/).

#### 4. For real life programming tasks we need storage. [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) database is good. Because of *elephant*.

#### 5. And finally, fancy word [Big Data](http://hadoop.apache.org/). Did you say "big"? *Elephants* are big.
