[randomorg-0.1](https://github.com/mishadoff/randomorg) released!

<!-- more -->

If you use random numbers in your software you might be interested in
better numbers distribution than `Random.nextInt()`.

Someone solves this problem with hardware generators, few entropy sources and
even [books](http://www.amazon.com/Million-Random-Digits-Normal-Deviates/dp/0833030477/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1373114958&sr=1-1&keywords=A+Million+Random+Digits+with+100%2C000+Normal+Deviates).

By the way, there is great service [random.org](http://random.org)
which allows to generate random numbers via atmospheric noise.

**randomorg** is a small java library for random.org API.

Check project page for usage and documentation!
